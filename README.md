Challenge 2.01

Created a container with five flex items and within those items I created divs for the images:
First image had an animation of color changing border.
Second animation was a resizing the width from the left size of the image.
Last animation color changing element caption.
The last two images remained the same. 

When page is resized containers and items remain the same size width/height.
